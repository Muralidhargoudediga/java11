The BufferedReader and Files classes contain a lines() method that reads a file lazily and returns the contents as a stream of strings.
Each element in the stream represents one line of text from the file.
The file needs to be closed when you are done with the stream.
Calling the close() method on the stream will close the underlying file.
Alternatively, you can create the stream in a try-with-resources statement so the underlying file is closed automatically.
